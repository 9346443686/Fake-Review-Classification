#Fake Review Classification
Compiled a diverse dataset of authentic and fraudulent reviews, tokenizing and preprocessing the text for model input.
Designed a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture to capture long-range dependencies and local text patterns for review classification.
Developed and trained the model using CNN and LSTM layers, achieving high accuracy in identifying fake reviews, and evaluated performance using F1-score, accuracy, precision, and recall.
